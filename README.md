# App Engine EJS Template

This is a Node.js fullstack template based off an express REST API and static front-end files templated with ejs.

The docs are still WIP but the aim is for this to be a self-contained set of resources to allow people to deploy
full-stack Google App Engine projects in a self-service manner.
